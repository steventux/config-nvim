# Neovim/NVChad config

This is my personal Neovim config. It is based on the amazing [NvChad](nvchad/NvChad) starter.
The plugins and settings are intended for Python development.
Includes Copilot and Neovim and a Python LSP config.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to your Neovim config directory (usually `~/.config/nvim`).
2. Open Neovim and run `:MasonInstallAll` to install the plugins.


**This repo is supposed to used as config by NvChad users!**

- The main nvchad repo (NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- So you just import its modules , like `require "nvchad.options" , require "nvchad.mappings"`
- So you can delete the .git from this repo ( when you clone it locally ) or fork it :)
